# DID_METHODS — JSON array of resolver configs (single line).
# Fields:
#   method  : string (e.g. "empe") — DID method name (lowercase).
#   url     : string — RPC endpoint used to resolve DIDs for this method/network.
#   network : string (optional) — e.g. "testnet" or "mainnet".
#
# Matching rules:
#   1) From DID (e.g. did:empe:testnet:abc...), extract: method="empe", network="testnet".
#   2) Prefer exact match {method, network}.
#   3) If DID has no network (e.g. did:empe:abc...), treat as mainnet/none:
#        try {method,"mainnet"} then {method} (no network) as fallback.
#   4) If nothing matches → unsupported method/network error.
#
# JSON must be valid (double quotes, no trailing commas), on one line.
